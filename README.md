# Material Design Color Palette

We have been loving the color palette that Google has prescribed for its [Material Design language](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html). However we realized that we couldn't find a readymade palette that we can use in GIMP / Inkscape / Gravit Designer.

This is a fork from the [KiSSFLOW](http://kissflow.com). I converted the GIMP palette to a Gravit Designer (`.gvswatch`) one.

The GIMP version is also compatible with the [ColorZilla](http://www.colorzilla.com/firefox/palettes.html) extension.

# How To

## Gravit Designer
##### (Tested on 3.2.5)
Open Gravit Designer and create a document, to go to the Page Color property and select `Import Swatch`. :)

## GIMP
##### (Tested on 2.8.2)
Open the Palettes window with: `Windows > Dockable Dialogs > Palettes`. Once opened, click on `configure this tab` on the top right corner of the new window and select `Palettes Menu > Import Palette...`. Select the option `Palette file` and choose the downloaded file [Material-Design.gpl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KiSSFLOW/gimp-material-design-color-palette/master/Material-Design.gpl).

## Inkscape
##### (Tested on 0.48.3.1)
On Linux (Debian 3.2) copy the file [Material-Design.gpl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KiSSFLOW/gimp-material-design-color-palette/master/Material-Design.gpl) into `/usr/share/inkscape/palettes/`, and then (re)launch Inkscape.
